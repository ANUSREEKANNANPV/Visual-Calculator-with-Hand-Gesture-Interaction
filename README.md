# Visual-Calculator-with-Hand-Gesture-Interaction
This project, powered by #OpenCV and #MediaPipe, introduces a  way to interact with numbers. Through the use of intuitive hand gestures, users can perform real-time mathematical operations seamlessly. The code captures live video feed, detects hand landmarks, and recognizes specific gestures corresponding to digits and operators.
